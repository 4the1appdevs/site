# Sufone (ÿµŸÅŸàÿßŸÜ) Website & Overview
Homepage for the org; we have an amazing URL ready. 

Hoping to make a pretty static site, to replace the page on  personal site: https://navedislam.com/apps . Site copy should be based on on the old site.

Design drafts: https://www.figma.com/file/jIubmgm289vAfTuV1I0crg/Suf.one

*No further work on this site until there is actually one consistent contributor‚Ä¶ people first, then infrastructure!*

# Vision of the Cooperative

A cooperative is "an autonomous association of persons united voluntarily to meet their common economic, social, and cultural needs and aspirations through a jointly-owned enterprise" ‚Äì beautiful! But before getting ahead of ourselves, 

## Mission

Fulfill the digital needs of Muslims through apps that are excellent because of:

1. Pursuing the best qualities in every app: speed, power and beauty. *Ihsan* is pursued in every part of the experience.
2. Community engagement and open-source: Open-source is so‚Ä¶ Islamic! Cooperation between people, sharing progress to the wider world and keeping software open to contributors of all kind to work towards the best software for all. 

Community participation is the heart of Sufone: to nurture the ummah's spirit and work together, to develop skills and let contributors have experience in all parts of such a beautiful effort, and to emancipate people from their dependence on software made by companies seeking profit whose work is not released to the public.

A later stage of Sufone will be focused on financially supporting those Muslims who work on open source. Many amazing apps and resources come from people working as volunteers (like quran.com) outside of their full-time job, or are one-man projects! Sufone will collect and distribute funding 100% transparently, and hire people to work on these projects (those who already do and even more people!). 

We are highly inspired by [Nuqaya](https://nuqayah.com/) and the suite of apps by Ustadh Mustafa üíó

## Structure

Two overall teams working together:

- Project
- Community

The Project team include programmers, designers and all those working to build apps and digital experiences. 

The Community team is the open channel of the public to send their feedback and struggles to the Project team, and to communicate to the general public. Marketing, support, and so on.

To start with, people will probably be part of both teams at the same time, and there should of course be a lot of overlap and work across teams (specially for roles like writing documentation or blogs). But specialization of skills or at least attention is beneficial for the greater effectiveness.

There'll be an overall

Of course, this whole vision for Sufone is a quick draft of big dreams‚Ä¶ but it's a community project, and I hope others can find the same dream within themselves and we can work towards the same goal üòä
